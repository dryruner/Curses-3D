Here's an explaination of how to use this:

Cube2.c is basically the entire 'format' models must be in. You can change rendering methods using the 
primary render function. I'm sure there's a simple way to convert objs to this format using a bash
script of sorts, feel free to make one for everyone! :D

And please, feel free to make edits and commit to the project!

*PLEASE READ*
Considering compilation, for some reason I cannot link c3d to the cube2 executable, anyone who knows what may
be the problem please contact me @ ircsurfer33(at)gmail(dot)com
