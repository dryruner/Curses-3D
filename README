Here's an explaination of how to use this:

Cube2.c is basically the entire 'format' models must be in. You can change rendering methods using the 
primary render function. I'm sure there's a simple way to convert objs to this format using a bash
script of sorts, feel free to make one for everyone! :D

And please, feel free to make edits and commit to the project!

Here's how to compile:
gcc -Wall c3d.c c3d.h cube2.c -o cube -lcurses -lm

just replace cube2.c with your own model. This way of doing things will change.
